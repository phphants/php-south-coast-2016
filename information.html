            <h4>By Car with Park &amp; Ride</h4>
            <p>
                Portsmouth operates a park &amp; ride system which has services to The Hard Interchange. You
                can find more information on the Park &amp; Ride scheme

            <h4>By Air (via Southampton Airport)</h4>
            <p>
                The closest airport is <a href="http://www.southamptonairport.com/">Southampton</a> which
                serves many cities around the UK and Europe, mostly through Flybe and Ryanair. Transfer from the
                airport can be via a pre-booked airport taxi, or you can catch a train from <em>Southampton
                Airport Parkway</em> railway station to <em>Portsmouth Harbour</em> (change at
                <em>Eastleigh</em>).
            </p>

            <h4>By Air (via London Gatwick Airport)</h4>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you may find flights to <a href="http://www.gatwickairport.com/">London Gatwick
                Airport</a>, which has reasonably priced direct train links to <em>Portsmouth Harbour</em> (see
                "By Rail" for more information).
            </p>

            <h4>By Air (via London Heathrow Airport)</h4>
            <p>
                For flights landing at Heathrow, it's easiest to catch the Rail-link transfer to Woking, and then a
                train down to Portsmouth Harbour. For schedules, check out <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">the
                Trainline.com</a>.

                Portsmouth Harbour). The coach and bus station is just across from the dockyard entrance.
            </p>

            <h4>By Ferry</h4>
            <p>
                If you're coming over from the Isle of Wight, you need to get either the passenger or car
                ferry to the <em>Portsmouth</em> terminals. For international arrivals coming to the ferry
                terminal, you will need to arrange a way of getting from the terminal to the conference as
                the ferry terminal is on the north-west of the city.
            </p>
