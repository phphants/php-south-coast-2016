            <h2>Ticket Scholarship Programme</h2>
            <p class="lead">We are pleased to announce our Ticket Scholarship Programme for PHP South Coast 2016.</p>
        </header>

        <p>
            At PHP South Coast, we are committed to including as many people as possible in our conference. This year
            we are introducing a ticket scholarship scheme to encourage students, under-represented groups and those
            who can't otherwise afford tickets to experience our events.
        </p>

        <h3>I would like to enrol&hellip;</h3>
        <p>
            Sorry, but the scholarship programme is no longer accepting applications for this year.
        </p>

        <h3>I would like to help&hellip;</h3>
        <p>
            Thank you to everyone has donated - we have closed the scholarship programme for this year.
        </p>

        <h4>A massive thank you to our donors&hellip;</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>James Titcumb</li>
            <li>Toby Griffiths</li>
            <li>Ciaran McNulty</li>
            <li>and 3x anonymous donors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Regarding VAT on donations</h4>
        <p>
            The donations are being made to PHP Hampshire CIC, which is not a charity. Therefore, there are no tax
            benefits on donations for any party involved. It is important to also note that donors will not be able
            to reclaim VAT on donations, as the supply is being made to the scholarship awardee, rather than the
            donor. This does indeed mean that technically, the scholarship awardee could claim the VAT you have
            paid back, but also be aware that we do not award scholarships to businesses, so there is no risk of
            money making schemes here. Please ensure that if you are a VAT-registered company making a donation
            that you account for this correctly in your VAT return.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Regarding surplus of funding</h4>
        <p>
            If the scholarship programme raises more money than we are able to award tickets for, the surplus will
            be used to either fund next year's scholarship programme, or in the unlikely event we will not run
            another scholarship scheme (or even conference!) then the surplus will be donated to a similar
            not-for-profit scholarship programme or a registered charity with similar interests (at our discretion).
