                        So, you've been through and changed all your double quotes to single quotes but your

                        Making an application scale is generally seen as something that only the most magical of
                        developers can do, but it's easy once you have the correct tools. Fortunately for us, these
                        tools are freely available online!

                        In this talk, we'll take a look at a few options that we have available to work out what our
                        application is actually doing, help identify bottlenecks and fix them so that we can move on to
                        the more important part of the project: delivering features. "

                        A Functional Guide to Cat Herding with PHP Generators

                    <p>
                        When working with arrays in PHP, three of the most useful functions available to us are
                        array_map(), array_filter() and array_reduce(), which allow us to walk an array and manipulate the
                        value of array elements, select a subset of values from an array, or reduce an array to a single
                        value; all using a callback function to determine exactly what logic should be applied. The use
                        of the callback makes them extremely flexible, and these functions can be particularly powerful,
                        especially when combined (or chained) together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, these functions only work with standard PHP arrays; so if we are using Generators as a
                        data source instead of an array, then we can't take advantage of the functionality that they
                        provide. Fortunately, it's very easy to emulate that functionality and apply it to Generators
                        (and also to other Traversable objects like SPL Iterators), giving us access to all of the
                        flexibility and power that mapping, filtering and reducing can offer, and with all the benefits
                        that Generators can offer our code.
                    </p>
                    <p>So how do we go about implementing filter(), map() and reduce() functions for our Generators? How
                        do we use those functions in our applications? I'll be answering those two questions, and
                        explaining how I keep track of my cats armed only with a GPS Tracker and, PHP Generators, and
                        filter/map/reduce.

                        Fast, discrete APIs are a key part of many web applications and Slim 3 is a fantastic platform
                        for building them. With a focus on PSR-7, the new standard for HTTP messaging in PHP, Slim's
                        middleware focus and ability to get out of the way ensure thats you can buld APIs that are a joy
                        to work with. We'll cover content-type handling, accept header awareness, error handling and all
                        the other things required to ensure that your APIs are easy to integrate with. By the end of
                        this session you will be well placed to write your own APIs with Slim 3.

                        So, you do code reviews, and that's great. But there's always more that you can check during the
                        review. More places you can check for any potential bugs or problems before deployment, before
                        you find yourself with technical debt. Or worse: unforeseen downtime.

                        PHP 7 has arrived! One of the major features that it brings with it is the ability to use scalar
                        typing. Are you ready for it? Join me as we take a tour through PHP 7's type system from end to
                        end. Don't know what a type is? Come and find out! Are you a seasoned type user? Come learn how
                        to leverage the new options! Confused about weak vs strict types? We'll cover concept, theory
                        and practical details of the type system while exploring how PHP's type system compares to other
                        languages.

                        Thank to cloud computing to split processes on different machines now is very easy, during this
                        talk I will share an experience made in Corley SRL with the Zend Framework Core Team to split
                        all ZF's git history in different isolated components (one of the main feature of ZF3). I chose
                        this case study because it helps me to explain as it is easy with AWS, a bit of PHP and bash
                        split an history made of other 20.000 commits.

                        PhpSpec is a tool for "SpecBDD". Basically test-driven development (TDD) but without the word
                        "test" in it. This talk shows how to effectively use PhpSpec for fun and/or profit, and the
                        advantages to using it along side other tools like PHPUnit and why it's "literally" made of
                        awesomesauce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll start off with a breakneck primer on unit testing with PHPUnit and basic TDD concepts.
                        Then we'll move on to getting set up with PhpSpec, followed by a guided tour of its main
                        features. By the end of the talk you'll have techniques to take advantage of your natural
                        inclination to lazyness to actually help you write better code.

                        After 16 years a new version of the HTTP protocol has now been finalized and wide support in
                        browsers and web servers is coming quickly. In this talk I'll explain how HTTP and browsers work
                        in general and what you currently have to do to make your application as fast as possible. Based
                        on this I'll show what HTTP/2.0 is all about, what it changes and how it can help your
                        application's performance.

                        after almost 4 years of work and code commits by over 3,200 different contributors. Whilst
                        it's pretty much the same as the Drupal that we know and, hopefully, love, a lot has changed
                        behind the scenes and under the hood!

                    <p>
                        In this talk, I'll highlight some of the new features and improvements in Drupal 8, and discuss
                        some of the benefits to Drupal site builders, themers, and module developers. I'll also talk
                        about some of the non-technical changes and the cultural shift from "not invented here" to
                        "proudly found elsewhere", and how we are rejoining the PHP herd.

                        Language runtimes do their best to meet all your development needs, but sometimes there's some
                        random C library you need access to from a higher level language, and it's just not there.
                        Learning PHP's zvals and HashTables, and its score of macros and pointers can be intimidating
                        and off-putting. I'll show that there's a better way: HHVM extensions require little more
                        experience than a firm knowledge of PHP, and a willingness to break things. By the end of this
                        presentation, we'll have live-coded a real-world extension wrapping a real-world library, and
                        you'll be able to as well.

                        I have a love-hate relationship with WordPress, but whether you like it or not, it powers 23% of
                        the Internet. Many of these projects have outgrown their humble beginnings as blogs or websites
                        and are now highly customised web applications. However the modern tools we use as PHP
                        developers can be tricky to utilise with the popular blogging platform.
